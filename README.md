# 👋🏼 Hi, I'm Marc Anthony Aradillas  

Cloud Engineer | Data & Analytics Engineering | Software Developer  
U.S. Air Force Veteran | B.S. Computer Science (Software Engineering)

I'm a technologist with experience in cloud operations (AWS), data engineering pipelines, analytics workflows, and applied machine learning. I enjoy solving complex problems, building clean and reliable systems, and turning raw data into something meaningful.

My background includes:
- Cloud engineering (AWS EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, SSM, automation)
- Data engineering & analytics using Python, SQL, and ETL pipelines
- Machine learning and NLP projects built end-to-end
- Software engineering foundations (OOP, web apps, secure coding, Git)
- Military discipline, leadership, and mission-critical operations

I am actively expanding into **Analytics Engineering** and **Data Engineering**, including Palantir Foundry concepts, modern pipelines, and scalable data systems.
